# r2-2wr-simulation

The purpose of this project is to create a working Gazebo model of the
RasPiRobot Rover Kit and use it to develop ROS2 software that can then be
tested on real hardware.

After starting this project, I decided to develop the hardware first.  As this is a personal project, I decided to do what was fun instead of what was needed by work.

The hardware [readme](hardware/README/md) explains how to program the ESP2-CAM modules and connect it to the hardware.
